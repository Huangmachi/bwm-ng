What is this?
=============

Bandwidth Monitor NG is a small and simple console-based live bandwidth 
monitor for Linux, BSD, Solaris, Mac OS X and others.

Short list of features:
- supports /proc/net/dev, netstat, getifaddr, sysctl, kstat and libstatgrab
- unlimited number of interfaces supported
- interfaces are added or removed dynamically from list
- white-/blacklist of interfaces
- output of KB/s, Kb/s, packets, errors, average, max and total sum
- output in curses, plain console, CSV or HTML
- configfile

This was influenced by the old bwm util written by ...... (couldnt find any 
author, debian package: bwm Maintainer: Lenart Janos <ocsi@debian.org>) which 
had some issues with faster interfaces and was very simple. Since i had almost
all code done anyway for other projects, i decided to create my own version.

I actually dont know if netstat input is usefull at all. I saw this elsewhere,
so i added it. Its target is "netstat 1.42 (2001-04-15)" linux or 
Free/Open/NetBSD. If there are other formats i would be happy to add them.

For info about libstatgrab please refer to http://www.i-scream.org/libstatgrab/

INSTALL
=======

For detailed decription please read INSTALL
./configure --help for a list of options

./configure
make

to install use as root: 
make install


Specs
=====

csv output format: 
unix timestamp;iface_name;bytes_out/s;bytes_in/s;bytes_total/s;bytes_in;bytes_out;packets_out/s;packets_in/s;packets_total/s;packets_in;packets_out;errors_out/s;errors_in/s;errors_in;errors_out\n
Use --count 0 to skip the all zero output after start.

html output format:
edit the bwm-ng.css to modify the output. Please note the htmlrefresh only 
modifies the META refresh, you maybe wanna sync --timeout and --htmlrefresh


USAGE
=====

USAGE: bwm-ng [OPTION] ... [CONFIGFILE]
Please read the manpage or `bwm-ng -h` for a list and explanation of options.


Keybindings (curses only):
  'h'     show help
  'q'     exit
  '+'     increases timeout by 100ms
  '-'     decreases timeout by 100ms
  'k','d' switch KB and auto assign Byte/KB/MB/GB
  'a'     cycle: show all interfaces, only those which are up, 
                 only up and not hidden
  's'     sum hidden ifaces to total aswell or not
  'n'     cycle: input methods
  'u'     cycle: bytes,bits,packets,errors
  't'     cycle: current rate, max, sum since start, average for last 30 sec
	

Configfile
==========

either via cmdline or /etc/bwm-ng.conf or ~/.bwm-ng.conf
it consists of:
longoption=value
with 1 or 0 as values for keys without a value in cmdline options.

For more help take a look at bwm-ng.conf-example


Misc
====

Bugs/Known Problems:
  - curses output coredumps on netbsd 1.6.1 (maybe others) with unknown TERM
    set and configfile support compiled in
  - no other yet, wow ;) (please report if you found one)
 
Todo:
  - Docs
  - try to avoid kmod, like net-tools do, for socket() for ioctl
  - maybe change sscanf() use in retrieve.c to gettoken()
  - checking options to be valid
  - mysql output (ipac-ng compatible)
  - setting which stats to output for csv/sql
  - whatever you can think of
