  ..-..-.... 0.5: pre1:
                  - fixed invalid option msg showed up twice
                  - added --sumhidden, by default hidden ifaces dont count for
                    total anymore
                  - added show iface cycle for gui (curses yet) mode: 
                    up and not hidden, up and hidden, all
                  - if ifacelist (-I) is prefaced with % it behaves like a
                    blacklist
                  - get_options (long_options) cleanup
                  - fixed wrong values on proc/net/dev wrap around.
                  - fixed several configure and compile issues
                  - added output correct error messages
                  - added Solaris support (kstat and netstat)
                  - fixed segfault with getifaddrs on MacOSX < 10.3
                  - fixed NetBSD/OpenBSD compile 
                  - added NetBSD/OpenBSD netstat support
                  - fixed netstat parsing if address field missing
                  - fixed showing same iface twice on netstat input
                  pre2:
                  - added outfile and daemonize for html output
                  - fixes for IRIX
                  - added bit/second output (Michael Eckhoff)
  12-20-2004 0.4: pre1:
                  - get_iface_stats cleanup
                  - plain and csv output added
                  - splited the big bwm-ng.c
                  - interface list added (whitelist)
                  - -lncurses instead of -lcurses, hope this will work on more
                    boxes
                  pre2:
                  - html output added, bwm-ng.css prolly needs alot of tweaking
                  pre3:
                  - added BSD support via sysctl (only fbsd tested yet)
                  - fixed gcc warnings on old/non x86 systems
                  - added errors output (inverse in curses)
                  - added libstatgrap support 
                  - another get_iface_stats cleanup/split
                  - Makefile edit (added options)
                  - fixed removed interfaces can cause a blank line
                  - added -D__CURSES, if not defined, you can build without
                    libcurses
                  - changed plain output with count>1 to almost the same as
                    curses output except inputkeys and errors support
                  - added -D__HTML and -D__CSV to select output at compiletime
                  pre4 and final:
                  - added configure script and config.h
                  - changed input_method handling (cycling while running works 
                    now for all methods)
                  - sysctl input added (mostly for BSD), the old sysctl was
                    getiffaddrs() actually
                  - netstat input for BSD fixed
                  - html cleanup and <html> header is now opt: --htmlheader
                  - using real time elapsed since last probe to calc byte/s
                    old method is backup if no gettimeofday is available
                  - switched in and out in plain, curses and html output
                  - support for configfiles added
  09-16-2004 0.3: - cosmetic changes, KB/s is now default (again)
                  - netstat input added
                  - packet output added
                  - show only-up-interfaces or all
  09-07-2004 0.2: - rewrote parsing
                  - cosmetic changes
                  - changed to dynamic allocated and displayed interfaces
                  - possible to auto switch Byte KB and MB per second
  09-07-2004 0.1: - initial release, almost if not all features of old bwm
